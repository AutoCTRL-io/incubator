ESP32 Incubator Firmware – Project Architecture Plan
Overview

This firmware controls an incubator using an ESP32-S3.
It supports egg holding (preservation) and incubation, with profile-driven temperature/humidity targets, automatic egg turning via a stepper motor, and a web UI with real-time updates.

The system is intentionally modular, with strict separation of concerns.
All behavior is driven by data + state, not hardcoded logic.

Core Design Principles

incubator.ino is the entry point only

All state lives in one place

All decisions live in one place

Sensors provide data, they do not decide

Actuators act, they do not decide

UI never directly controls hardware

Profiles are data, not logic

Custom profiles modify ProcessState, not global defaults

File-by-File Responsibilities
1. incubator.ino

Role: Application entry point (Arduino equivalent of main.cpp)

Contains:

setup()

loop()

Initialization order

Calls into other modules

Does NOT contain:

Logic

State

Math

Web routes

Hardware control

Responsibilities:

Initialize subsystems

Call periodic “tick” functions

2. app_state.h / app_state.cpp

Role: Single source of truth for all data and runtime state

Contains:

Enums:

EggProfileId

ProcessType (NONE / EGG_HOLDING / INCUBATION)

ControlMode (UNMANAGED / MANAGED)

Structs:

EggProfileData (static biological defaults)

ProcessState (runtime process)

Global instance:

ProcessState process

Persistent storage (NVS):

load/save of ProcessState

Profile lookup:

getProfile(profileId)

Does NOT contain:

Control logic

Sensor reads

Motor control

Web code

Purpose:
Everything the system knows lives here.

3. core_controller.h / core_controller.cpp

Role: Brain of the system (decision engine)

Contains:

Process lifecycle:

start

cancel

transition holding → incubation

Day tracking (epoch → day count)

Target resolution:

derives effective temp/humidity/turning from:

ProcessState

EggProfileData

Heater / alarm decisions (later)

Egg turning scheduling

Calls motor driver when it is time to turn eggs

Does NOT contain:

Sensor math

Web routes

HTML

GPIO pin definitions (except via other modules)

Purpose:
Given the current state and data, decide what should happen.

4. sensor_dht.h / sensor_dht.cpp

Role: Environmental data provider

Contains:

DHT22 initialization

Sensor reads

Derived metrics:

Temp °C / °F

Relative humidity

Absolute humidity

Dew point

Heat index

SensorData struct

Does NOT contain:

Targets

Profiles

Decisions

Control logic

Purpose:
Return the current environment as data, nothing more.

5. motor_stepper.h / motor_stepper.cpp

Role: Egg-turning actuator

Contains:

Stepper motor pin configuration

Initialization

Single “turn eggs” action

Busy / safety state

Does NOT contain:

Scheduling

Profiles

Timing decisions

Web/UI logic

Purpose:
Physically rotate eggs when instructed by the core controller.

6. web_server.h / web_server.cpp

Role: HTTP server and REST API

Contains:

WebServer instance

Route registration

Endpoints such as:

/ (UI)

/api/state

/api/process/start

/api/process/cancel

/api/process/transition

JSON serialization of state

Does NOT contain:

HTML strings

Control logic

Hardware access

Purpose:
Allow the UI (or future clients) to view and modify state safely.

7. ws_server.h / ws_server.cpp

Role: Real-time push channel

Contains:

WebSocket server

Client connect/disconnect handling

Periodic broadcast of:

sensor data

process state

resolved targets

motor status

Does NOT contain:

Decisions

Hardware control

State mutation (except acknowledgements)

Purpose:
Keep the UI in sync with the running system.

8. web_assets.h

Role: Static web UI content

Contains:

INDEX_HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Does NOT contain:

Logic

State

Routing

C++ code

Purpose:
Provide a human interface without coupling to firmware logic.

Functional Features (Implemented or Planned)

Egg holding (preservation) mode

Incubation mode

Profile-based biological defaults

Custom profile support

Day tracking from arbitrary start day

Automatic egg turning via stepper motor

Real-time UI updates

Persistent recovery after reboot

Safe transitions between modes

Future-ready humidity control

Future-ready rescue / override modes

Key Architectural Guarantees

No duplicated state

No hidden coupling

No UI-driven hardware access

Profiles are immutable defaults

Custom behavior lives in ProcessState

Hardware can be swapped without refactoring logic

Mental Model Summary

app_state = what the system is

sensor_dht = what the environment is

core_controller = what the system decides

motor_stepper = what the system does physically

web_server / ws_server = how humans interact

incubator.ino = glue, nothing else
